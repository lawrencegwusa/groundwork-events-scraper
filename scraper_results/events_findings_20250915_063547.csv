Your work will improve habitat for humans who use the greenspace for recreation and wildlife that call it home. Activities include hand-pulling and cutting invasive plants such as English ivy, Chinese privet, and kudzu in a densely wooded area off trail. Physical activity such as bending, pulling, lifting, and kneeling is required. Forest restoration can be physically strenuous - be ready to break a sweat and get dirty and learn a lot while doing it!For more information and to sign up for a date, visit: https://www.treesatlanta.org/get-involved/events/",https://www.groundworkatlanta.org/events/2023/1/21/woodall-creek-forest-restoration-r88t2-fpx8e-fgmsk-4jkkc-xx6b2-58x4r-97ake-g2haa,2025-09-15 06:21:25
