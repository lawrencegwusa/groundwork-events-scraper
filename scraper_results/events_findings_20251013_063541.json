Led by volunteers Chuck and Chris (see more below), we will do easier hikes to come together and enjoy CT\u2019s natural scenery. On December 7, we will be hiking a flat rail-trail portion of the Pequonnock River Trail. View the parking location HERE. Note: The trail is popular and gets busy on the weekends, so parking may be limited. We encourage you to arrive 15 minutes early. If there are no parking spots available, park in the large lot across the street (near the Starbucks on White Plains Road) and walk over to the meeting area.Use this form to sign the waiver for the 12/7 hike. Sign up for future updates HERE.\n\n\n\nChuck Winchell grew up in the Mill Hill area of Bridgeport in the 60\u2019s. He has been involved with Groundwork Bridgeport since its inception in 1998, having served as a Board member and Chair. Chuck retired from the United Illuminating Company and enjoyed a second career with the State of Connecticut\u2019s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. In 1981 he hiked 1,000 miles of the Appalachian Trail and has been chipping away at the remaining 1,100 ever since. Besides hiking, Chuck\u2019s other interests include swimming, biking, and weekly pinochle games.Chris Allen, a retired Agriscience teacher from Trumbull High School, specialized in the plant science portion of the program. He holds a degree in plant science from Penn State and has expertise in greenhouse production, hydroponics, and plant tissue culture. An avid hiker, Chris has explored nearly all local hiking trails, the Connecticut Appalachian Trail, and several peaks in New Hampshire's White Mountains.",
